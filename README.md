Please help me with line 64 in "read.html"
I created a button that when you press will take you back to the launch/home page
However, when I do '<form action="./home.html/">' and I check back on my "Blog Posts" page and press the button, I get this feedback:
"Cannot GET /class-project-group-2/Landing%20Page/pages/read/home.html/"
I tried doing "../home.html" to go back a file but it still doesn't work
