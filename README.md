Please help me with line 64 in "read.html".
I created a button that when you press will take you back to the launch/home page.
However, when I do form action="./home.html/" (with the < & >, I didn't put it in because the entire line wouldn't show up) and I check back on my "Blog Posts" page and press the button, I get this feedback:
"Cannot GET /class-project-group-2/Landing%20Page/pages/read/home.html/".
I tried doing "../home.html" to go back a file but it still doesn't work.
